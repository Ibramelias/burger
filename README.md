## Description.
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Each burger on the right side of the page will have a Delete Button. When the user clicks delete, it will be removed from the db and the page.

## How to install Locally 
* Clone the repo to your local machine.
* Using schema.sql and seed.sql create and populate a burger_db database.
* Run `npm install` to pull in dependencies.
* Run `node server.js` from project route to start the webserver.

## How to use this App.
* Use the submit button and input box to make your own burger.
* Use the Eat and Delete buttons to eat or delete a burger.
