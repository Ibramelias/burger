## Burger
create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express and a homemade ORM (yum!).

## Description.
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Each burger on the right side of the page will have a Delete Button. When the user clicks delete, it will be removed from the db and the page.
